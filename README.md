# JpCarrierAppDeleter
## CarrierAppDeleter.Forms
Implementation of CarrierAppDeleter(WPF) with WinForms

### Why WinForms?
* Application should be multi-platform
* .NET Core supports WPF/WinForms on Windows only
* Currently(2022/7/27), Mono doesn't support WPF but WinForms

Therefore, it has been used.
